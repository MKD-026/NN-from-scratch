# NN-from-scratch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network using the following:
- Gradient descent
- Forward and backward propagation
- Relu, softmax activation functions
---
### Requirements:
```
python
numpy, pandas and matplotlib
```

In the future, I plan to implement various image classification and object detection frin scratch.
